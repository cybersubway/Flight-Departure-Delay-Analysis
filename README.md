Analysis of Flight Departure Delays: An Exploration into Machine Learning ‚úàÔ∏è

Analyzing airplane departure delays, which can result in major disruptions, is an intriguing machine learning topic. An outline of a recent project in which we addressed this issue from start to finish is provided below:

üìä Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Modeling was particularly difficult due to the unstructured, raw data. Changed the data into a clear, organized JSON format in order to solve issue. This was one of the most important and challenging step. We were able to efficiently examine features and get the dataset ready for additional processing as a result.

üîç Feature Engineering & Selection: After performing a thorough correlation study, developed more features that would improve model performance in order to determine which characteristics were the most influential. The most pertinent data was used to train the machine learning model thanks to this phase.

‚öñÔ∏è Resolving Class Imbalance: Models have trouble generalizing because of the very unbalanced dataset. To improve the resilience of the model and balance the data, we used strategies like undersampling.

Experimented with a variety of methods, such as Random Forest, KNN, and Logistic Regression, for the purpose of training and optimizing the model. Averaging 82% accuracy and 84% F1-score, the Random Forest model was the best performer. By using Grid Search to refine the model, we were able to increase its accuracy to 86%.

üìà Key Takeaways: Constructing a successful machine learning model requires careful data cleaning, perceptive feature engineering, and efficient management of unbalanced datasets. Analysis and prediction of flight delays were shown to be very promising tasks for the optimized Random Forest model.
